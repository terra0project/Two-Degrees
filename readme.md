This repo contains all of the code making up 'Two Degrees', a single NFT created for
Sotheby's '[Natively Digital: A Curated NTF Sale](https://www.sothebys.com/en/buy/auction/2021/natively-digital-a-curated-nft-sale-2/)' exhibition and auction.

A full write-up of the conceptual approach behind the project, plus a technical overview, can be found [here](https://terra0.medium.com/two-degrees-nft-5af1263bfcc).

#### Smart Contracts

There are two main smart contracts: an ERC721 Token, and a custom Oracle contract.

- `TemperatureOracle.sol` stores the average annual temperature rise as decided by NASA in their [annual report](https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/graphs/graph_data/Global_Mean_Estimates_based_on_Land_and_Ocean_Data/graph.txt), which can be updated by the `o-address`, an automated event listener running on a server. When this value crosses the threshold of 2 degrees centigrade, the token is able to be burned by anyone who wants to call the token contract's `burn()` function and do so.

- `TemperatureToken` implements a standard ERC721 interface using most OpenZeppelin  functions. There is a small custom ACL which allows the `TemperatureOracle` contract to burn the minted token if the annual average temperature increase is > 2 degrees Celsius.
